# LiftMate calory counting
# Overview

This assignment was to learn react. In particular I wanted to learn more about use states and effects.
I also wanted to learn more about hooks, and making a astetic site.


In this web app, there is a database, which it calls to show what food you have added to breakfast lunch or dinner.
When you add something it will stay there. It uses a basic USDA food call, so that you can see the calories from it.
If you want to see the website you can click [Here.](https://lift-mate.web.app/)

You can install the web app yourself by
* cloning it to your computer
* Installing Node.js
* Terminal over to the directory, and run ```npm start```
